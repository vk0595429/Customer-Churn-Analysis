# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a customer churn dataset to uncover insights that help understand why customers leave a service. The goal is to use visual and statistical analysis to identify key patterns and trends related to churn behavior.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Description**: The dataset contains information such as customer demographics, service subscriptions, internet usage, and churn status (whether the customer left or not).

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## 🔍 Project Objectives

1. Understand the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.
2. Explore relationships between features like tenure, contract type, and churn.
3. Use visualizations to reveal trends and patterns.
4. Summarize key findings that could help reduce customer churn.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load the dataset using `pandas` and display basic structure using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Removed or imputed where necessary

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed categorical and numerical features  
   - Visualized data using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps  
   - Investigated feature relationships and their impact on churn

## 📈 Key Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates.
- Longer-tenured customers are less likely to churn.
- Features like Internet Service type and Payment Method also show visible patterns in churn behavior.

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis provides a strong foundation for understanding customer behavior and identifying at-risk customers. These insights can be used by business teams to craft better retention strategies.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Include correlation analysis using statistical tests
- Build predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)
- Deploy insights in a dashboard format using tools like Tableau or Power BI
